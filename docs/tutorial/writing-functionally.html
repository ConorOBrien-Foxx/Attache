    <h1>Writing Functionally</h1>

<!-- meta-index: 2 -->

<p>So, in a language lacking constructs typical in programming languages, just how does one go about writing code? Most problems can be modelled with some combination of transformations and filters. Programming in Attache is concerned with implementing and combining maps and filters to solve problems.</p>

<p>Attache makes combining and applying functions a painless and convenient process. Most programming is involved with devising functions to suit your needs by applying existing functions to inputs. A large variety of functions and predicates are at your disposal so that you as a programmer spend less time implementing base functions and more time concerned with the logic of your program.</p>

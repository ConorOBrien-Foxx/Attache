# Solving Problems in Project Euler
<!-- meta-index: 1000 -->

Project Euler is a fantastic website for honing your problem-solving and mathematical skills. This page will approach a few of these problems in Attache. **I cannot encourage you enough to try these problems on your own _before_ reading the rest of this page.** You will spoil these problems for yourself if you haven't already done them. I will be showing programs and answers, so **there will be spoilers**.

Sorry, did you say you _haven't_ heard of Project Euler? Stop everything you are doing and do some problems! The site can be found here: [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net/).

Enough of that, let's get started!

# Attache

Attache (pronounced "ah-tahsh") is a language that looks a lot like Mathematica. In practice, it is like Mathematica, but "faster" (that is, less capable), and also enjoys a bit less verbosity.

## Example programs

Hello, World!
```Mathematica
Print["Hello, World!"]
```
1000th prime number
```Mathematica
Print[Prime[1000]]
```
Reverse STDIN
```Mathematica
Stdout[Reverse[Stdin[]]]
```
